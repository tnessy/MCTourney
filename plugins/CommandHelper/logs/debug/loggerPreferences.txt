#  The logger preferences allow you to granularly define what information
#  is written out to file, to assist you in debugging or general logging.
#  You may set the granularity of all the tags individually, to any one of
#  the following values:
#  OFF - Turns off all logging for this module.
#  ON - Synonym for ERRORS
#  
#  ERROR - Logs errors, or other high importance messages.
#  WARNING - Logs warnings and above.
#  INFO - Logs informational notices, and above.
#  DEBUG - Logs useful debugging information, and above.
#  VERBOSE - Logs every little detail.
#  
#  
#  In many cases, components will only use the ERROR level, therefore, ON is a synonym.
#  However, in some cases, a component may give you more information if you set it lower.

#Logs when any persistance actions occur.
persistance=OFF

#Shows deprecation warnings

#Logs runtime errors, (exceptions that bubble all the way to the top)
runtime=ERROR

#Logs compiler errors (but not runtime errors)
compiler=ERROR

#Logs what file is requested when include() is used
includes=OFF

#Anything that doesn't fit in a more specific category is logged here.
general=ERROR
